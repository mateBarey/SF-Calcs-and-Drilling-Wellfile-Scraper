# SF-Calcs

This program is inspired by the ISCWSA Error model and guidelines for caclculating errors of uncertainty in 

a drilling well. The program uses 2 inputs a well inventory file holding information of existing wells and a 

planned well file holding information about directional plans of new wells. It calculates the risk of collision based on 

if  2 * sf  is greater then each wells 2 center to center distances. The output is a sheet with 4 tabs, 

a Flagged wells tabs with all corresponding API's, a non Flagged wells tab with all other information, and 2 other tabs

for labeling purposes.
